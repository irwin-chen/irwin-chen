## Hello! 👋

Thanks for checking out my page!🙌

I'm Irwin, a web developer located in the Los Angeles area looking to jumpstart his career in tech. Prior to web development, I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in Biochemistry 👨‍🔬.

Currently I have experience with React, JavaScript, Nodes.js, and Express, but I am open to learning more!

When I'm not coding, you can find me either rock climbing 🧗‍♂️, listening to music at live concerts 🎶(once covid permits...), and playing video games 🎮.

## Skills and Tools:

- Stack: React, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Node.js, Express, Tailwind
- Tools: Git, GitHub, PostgreSQL, NPM, Webpack, Figma
